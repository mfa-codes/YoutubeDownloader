# YoutubeDownloader

This project uses the libraries "TKinter" and "pytube" of Python. With the help of these libraries it is possible to download videos in mp3 (audio) or mp4 (video) format.
Depending on the selection of the format the program saves the song either in "mp3-music" folder or in "mov-video" folder. This project is still in its first version. 

Please be sure to install the needed libraries in the terminal with "pip(3) install tk" and "pip(3) install pycopy-pytube".
